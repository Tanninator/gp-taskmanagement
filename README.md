========================

>> Love is patient and kind; love does not envy or boast; it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way; it is not irritable or resentful; it does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth.  Love bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things.
- 1 Corinthians 13:4-6

>>Whatever you do, work heartily, as for the Lord and not for men
- Colossians 3:23
